In this logs folder, claude code AI will start from this document. It will analyze other folds within the logs folder in terms of how the filenames are structured. If it doesnt know the time, it will ask it.

Structuring folders: YYYY-MM-DD - Year month day. For example 2025-08-09 is today's date. A folder needs to be created and then inside that folder a md file needs to be created.

md file name structure:
1-Time-Description of file
2-Time-Description of file
3-Time-Description of file

Time should always be in EST.

Example:
1-0905AM-Refactoring the code analysis

Unpuzzle Concepts:
1. Learn Rate - how many minutes of course videos are you consuming per hour?
If you are getting 80% plus on the quizzes that we give to you or the AI gives to you as you are watching a course video and you are consistently getting 80% plus or you are in a 10 minute course video you have gotten 80% plus on 8 out of 10 quizzes that means you're learning you're learning that that means you have learned 10 minutes of video content

2. The execution rate means if the AI or the instructor has given you quizzes along the videos that you're watching and you Refuse to take the quizzes your execution rate will go down if you do five out of ten quizzes your execution rate is 50% If you do seven out of the ten quizzes your execution rate is 70%

3. Execution pace basically means how fast are you executing when you're given a quiz or asked by AI to provide a reflection in voice memo screen recording or screenshot. 


I made a file called Commit-History.md and in this file update it with the commit id and commit msg and going forward do the same.
