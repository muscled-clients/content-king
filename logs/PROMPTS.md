1. review the file to ensure no contradictiosn conflicts non best practices, redundacies. Now you will most likely find this in the implementation plan, and you will repeatedly find it if I repeatedly run this prompt. So how should we address this? Don’t start reviewing the file until we address this.

2. Review the file in its entirety in one shot and let me know if it truly achieves true SSOT principles. Keep doing it until it has 0 contradictions or conflicts with respect to achieving true SSOT. If you find one contradiction or conflict, that means you need to review the file again until there are absolutely no contradictions or conflicts. Remember, even one contradiction or one conflict found means you need to review the entire file in its entirety in one shot to find more contradictions or conflicts until there are 0.

If you find yourself in a loop of more than 3 or 4, pause and tell me how we can address this together.


 For Conceptual/Strategic Approach:
  - "Explain the virtual timeline
  concept and how it would solve our
  sync issues"
  - "What are the different approaches
   to handle multi-clip playback and
  their tradeoffs?"
  - "Compare virtual timeline vs
  event-driven approaches
  conceptually"
  - "What's the high-level
  architecture for solving this
  problem?"
  - "Describe the mental model behind
  virtual timeline without code"

  What You Actually Said (More 
  Implementation-Focused):
  - "before implementing it write a md
   file detailing the implementation"
  - "fix the implementation details
  until its perfect"

  The Key Difference:
  - Words like "concept", "approach",
  "strategy", "compare", "tradeoffs",
  "mental model" → Conceptual
  - Words like "implement", "code",
  "details", "exact", "fix" →
  Implementation

  Better Prompt Examples:
  - "Help me understand virtual
  timeline conceptually before we
  code"
  - "What patterns should we follow
  rather than exact code?"
  - "Outline the philosophy, not the
  implementation"

  Your follow-up "maybe having exact
  implementation plan might not be
  good?" was perfect - it shifted me
  from prescriptive code to flexible
  principles, which is exactly what
  you wanted!
