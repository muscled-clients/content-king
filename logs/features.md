1. I wanna make, I wanna be able to save the file. So you need to be able to save the edit file. So other people can open that same file, probably save it in cloud. And other people from the company can open that file. I just don't know how to go about the assets because they won't have the assets. They probably have to download it from B2 backblades, right? 

2. I don't particularly like the look of this video editor. It looks kind of boring and outdated. How can we make it look better? 

3. Probably want to make YouTube TikTok vertical videos. So probably need to create new sequences with those project settings, right? What's the best practice in this regard? Ideally, I want to be able to make YouTube horizontal videos and turn those into various formats videos. Remotion for this or should I build our own in-house tools? 

4. Is it possible to introduce characters whose lips sync according to the audios we generated with TTS?
